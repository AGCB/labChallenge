# Coding Challenge for a Software Lab

## Instructions for Viewing
1. git clone this project to a local directory
2. npm install
3. npm start.

## Challenge Directives
The goal of this exercise is to build a “Purchase Summary” user interface using React.


###### Key UI elements
  - The “Pickup savings” tooltip
  - The “See Item details” expander
  - The “Apply Promo code” expander(the button in this does not need to do anything)

Clicking on “See Item Details” toggles open/close all the items’ details (not individually)

Bonus points for building it in a responsive manner (scales by % of page width)
